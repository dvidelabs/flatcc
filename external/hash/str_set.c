/*
 * Simple default implementation of a hash set. The stored items are
 * zero-terminated strings. The hash table does not manage the
 * allocation of the strings, like it doesn't manage any stored items.
 * However, it items are created with, say, strndup, a destructor can be
 * provided to free each item when clearing the table. The remove
 * operation also returns the removed item so it can be deallocated by
 * callee.
 *
 * In general, the key and the item are different, but here they are the
 * same. Normally the key would be referenced by the item.
